=====

### Course Description
  * The Internet of Things is at the forefront of the next digital revolution and helps bridge the physical and digital worlds. This gives individuals, businesses, and other organizations the ability to collect an unprecedented amount of real-time data from the environment and increases data analytics to improve Business Intelligence. Attributes such as temperature, humidity, light, position and movement of objects can easily be captured and transmitted over the Internet to centralized databases. The Internet of Things also provides an opportunity to remotely monitor and control “Smart” objects allowing almost any device to become interactive and automated. This course teaches students how to connect, program, and build projects that leverage the Internet of Things technologies to remotely monitor objects and collect environmental data, as well as build web-enabled “Smart” appliances that can be remotely controlled over the Internet.
